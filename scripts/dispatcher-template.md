# Mini-Waza Dispatcher

Mini-Waza is a Codex plugin with no predefined workflow skills. Match only
against skills that exist in the routing table.

## Routing Table

<!-- routing-table:start -->
<!-- routing-table:end -->

## How This Works

1. Read the user's message.
2. If the routing table has a matching skill, read that skill file.
3. If no skill matches, do normal agent work and do not invent a skill.

Skills chain manually, not automatically.
