# Orchestration

Workflow orchestration puts a request back into the delivery flow:

```text
workflow -> gate -> assets -> case pattern -> primitive skill
```

It may call primitive skills. It must not merge their rules, boundaries,
or validations. A public workflow skill must keep its own workflow rule,
gate logic, internal skill routing, and disclosure boundary visible.

See [[skill/orchestrator]].
